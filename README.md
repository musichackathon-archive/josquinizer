Turn pop music into Renaissance counterpoint!  A project from the Monthly Music Hackathon at Spotify on 2015-02-28

Includes a few random scripts that will not be useless to anyone ever, lots of MIDIs of Renaissance music, and more!

3.mid and 9.mid are randomly processed versions of rigby.mid and fire.mid, which are the MIDIs of pop songs.
